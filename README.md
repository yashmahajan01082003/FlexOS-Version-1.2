# FlexOS - AI-based Universal OS Simulation

**FlexOS** is an innovative, AI-driven operating system simulation that integrates advanced hand and retina controls to provide a seamless user experience. The OS is designed to work across various devices and platforms, making it highly adaptable and responsive to different input methods.

## Features
- **AI-based Hand and Retina Control**: FlexOS uses cutting-edge AI algorithms to interpret hand gestures and retina movements as input methods, allowing for a more intuitive and immersive interaction with the OS.
- **Universal Compatibility**: The OS can be simulated across various platforms, including desktop, mobile, and wearable devices.
- **User Customization**: Users can personalize the interface and control methods based on their preferences.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: FlexOS efficiently manages system resources, ensuring smooth performance even on devices with limited hardware capabilities.
- **Security**: The OS integrates robust security features, including biometric authentication through retina scanning.

## Installation
To run **FlexOS** on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow (for AI model integration)
- OpenCV (for hand and retina tracking)
- PyTorch (if necessary for advanced models)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlexOS.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FlexOS
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Usage
Once the OS simulation is running, you can interact with it through hand gestures and retina movement. The system will recognize your input and respond accordingly, providing a dynamic and adaptive user interface.

### Hand Control Instructions
